As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were considered.[9] Chelsea F.C. was founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook),[1][10] opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards.\n",

The following season saw UEFA create the European Champions' Cup, but after objections from The Football League, Chelsea were persuaded to withdraw from the competition before it started.[21][22] Chelsea failed to build on this success, and spent the remainder of the 1950s in mid-table.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\\nlarge and limited training data.\\n∗Equal contribution.

Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and\\nhas been crucially involved in every aspect of this work.

The system is owned by the Chicago Department of Transportation and has been operated by Lyft since 2019. As of Sept 2021, Divvy operated 16,500 bicycles and over 800 stations, covering 190 square milesThe bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system.Divvy is available for use 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.Recently, Divvy e-scooters have made their way into the Loop, using the same docking stations that are already used for Divvy bikes.0 Divvy is now the first docked micromobility system in the nation that can accommodate bikes, ebikes, and scooters all in the same stations.The hybrid ebike allows riders to dock at any Divvy station or use the cable to lock to any e-station. They can also lock to a public bike rack within the service area for an extra $2.With more than 400 miles of bike lanes throughout Chicago and Evanston, Divvy is the best way to see the town.This projects talks about the type of ride preferred by users and the time of the year and days of the week and hour of the day where the usage peaks .The data along with the graph helps to analyze the average distance and duration of usage over 2020.What is Exploratory Data Analysis?Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.It requires the knowledge of statistics, probability and various other python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn etc.We need to ask interesting questions and interpret numbers and figures to generate useful insights .In this project, I have selected an divvy trips data 20192020 from kaggle to explore and analyze the trend in usage across the quarter. We’ll use the the python libraries pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and folium to do exploratory data analysis on the weather dataset.Here’s the outline of the steps we’ll follow:Downloading a dataset from an online sourceData preparation and cleaning with PandasOpen-ended exploratory analysis and visualizationAsking and answering interesting questionsSummarizing inferences and drawing conclusionsBy the end of the projects , we will be able to identify the places , the time and month of the quarter where divvy has to work on making changes to improve the revenue and expanding the availability of the bike sharing system .Installing the required PackagesBefore we begin, let’s install the required libraries .#!pip install numpy pandas  opendatasets matplotlib seaborn plotly folium --upgrade --quiet!pip install opendatasets seaborn --upgrade --quiet#used to download a dataset from kaggleimport opendatasets as od#Data analysis library in pythonimport pandas as pd#numerical computing libraryimport numpy as np# for creating static visualizations in Pythonimport matplotlibimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt#a high-level interface for drawing informative statistical graphics.import seaborn as sns#for creating interactive visualizationsimport plotly.express as px#plotting geospatial data with Foliumimport folium#to create wordcloud in pythonimport wordcloud#it turns on “inline plotting”, where plot graphics will appear in your notebook%matplotlib inlineDownloading the datasetThe data has been downloaded from the kaggle and you can learn more about the dataset by reading the dataset description on Kaggle from the url given below.divvy_trips_data_url=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdmasumomarjashim/divvy-trips-data-20192020?resource=download\"It consists of just multiple files, which is over 1 GB in size. We can also check the length of the file using the wc terminal command (only works on Linux and Mac).Let us load the data and create dataframe. We are combining the data available for different quarters for the year 2020. The dataset contains over 3.4 million rows and 14 columns. The dataset for the quarter_two_2020 ,quarter_three_2020 and quarter_four_2020 has an additional column ‘Unnamed:0’. Hence we drop the additional column to get equal number of columns so that we can concatenate the quarter wise dataset to get an entire dataset of the year 2020 for analysis.quarter_one_2020 = pd.read_csv(\"/content/divvy-trips-data-20192020/Divvy_Trips_2020_Q1.csv\")quarter_one_2020.head()#creating dataframe and dropping column \\'Unnamed: 0\\'quarter_two_2020 = pd.read_csv(\"/content/divvy-trips-data-20192020/Divvy_Trips_2020_Q2.csv\")quarter_two_2020.drop([\\'Unnamed: 0\\'],axis=1,inplace=True)quarter_two_2020.head()#creating dataframe and dropping column \\'Unnamed: 0\\'quarter_three_2020 = pd.read_csv(\"/content/divvy-trips-data-20192020/Divvy_Trips_2020_Q3.csv\")quarter_three_2020.drop([\\'Unnamed: 0\\'],axis=1,inplace = True)quarter_three_2020.head()#creating dataframe and dropping column \\'Unnamed: 0\\'quarter_four_2020 = pd.read_csv(\"/content/divvy-trips-data-20192020/Divvy_Trips_2020_Q4.csv\")quarter_four_2020.drop([\\'Unnamed: 0\\'],axis=1,inplace =True)quarter_four_2020.head()year=[quarter_one_2020,quarter_two_2020,quarter_three_2020,quarter_four_2020]We use the concat function of the pandas dataframe to join all the tables along the vertical axis to get a consolidated dataframe divvy_year_2020 containing the datas for the year 2020.Data Preparation and CleaningPandas dataframe.info() function is used to get a concise summary of the dataframe. It comes really handy when doing exploratory analysis of the data. To get a quick overview of the dataset we use the dataframe.info() function. function is used to get a concise summary of the dataframe. It comes really handy when doing exploratory analysis of the data. To get a quick overview of the dataset we use the dataframe.info() function.Pandas describe() is used to view some basic statistical details like percentile, mean, std, etc. of a data frame or a series of numeric valuesSince the null values in the dataframe are contained in the station id’s mostly ,we can remove the rows with null values using the dropna() function.The load time and memory gains depend on the nature of the dataset.Here we change the datatype of started_at and ended_at to datetime64[ns] .The rideable_type and member_casual are categorical columns hence we change the datatype to category.# changing datatype to datetime for started_at and ended_atdivvy_trips_df[\\'started_at\\']=pd.to_datetime(divvy_trips_df[\\'started_at\\'],               format=\\'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\\')divvy_trips_df[\\'ended_at\\']=pd.to_datetime(divvy_trips_df[\\'ended_at\\'],               format=\\'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\\')#coverting to categorical rideabletypedivvy_trips_df[\\'rideable_type\\']=pd.Categorical(divvy_trips_df.rideable_type)#converting to categorical member_casualdivvy_trips_df[\\'member_casual\\']=pd.Categorical(divvy_trips_df.member_casual)In order to help in our analysis we define three new columns into the dataframe .The Month gives the number corresponding to each month and Distance column gives the distance between start station and stop station calculated using the coordinates of each of them respectively in kilometers.Duration calculates the time taken for each ride in minutes.#Adding a new column `Month`divvy_trips_df[\\'Month\\'] = pd.DatetimeIndex(divvy_trips_df[\\'started_at\\']).month#function to calculate distanc from the coordinates.import numpy as npdef calculate_distance (lat1,lng1,lat2,lng2):  lat1,lng1,lat2,lng2 = map (np.radians,[lat1,lng1,lat2,lng2])  R=6373.0  dlat=lat2-lat1  dlng=lng2-lng1  a = (np.sin(dlat/2))**2 + np.cos (lat1) * np.cos(lat2)*(np.sin(dlng/2))**2  c=2 * np.arcsin(np.sqrt(a))  distance = R* c  return distanceDistance = calculate_distance (divvy_trips_df.start_lat,divvy_trips_df.start_lng,divvy_trips_df.end_lat,divvy_trips_df.end_lng)divvy_trips_df[\\'Distance\\'] = Distance#Adding a new column `Duration`divvy_trips_df[\\'Duration\\'] =(divvy_trips_df.ended_at -  divvy_trips_df.started_at)/pd.Timedelta(minutes=1)Dropping all columns in the table where distance is zero.There is greater chance that the entry made can be wrong.There are 279013 rows which has distance as null.Hence we drop all those rows.There are 8470 rows with duration as null.We drop all those rows as duration cannot be zero and negative.After data cleaning and preprocessing we now have a dataframe that has about 2.5 million rows and 15 columns.We have done pretty much in data cleaning section and let’s move to the next section i.e Open-ended exploratory analysis and visualization.#Dropping columns where distance covered is nulldivvy_trips_df.drop(divvy_trips_df[divvy_trips_df[\\'Distance\\'] == 0 ].index,inplace =True)#Checking for columns where duration is nulldivvy_trips_df[divvy_trips_df[\\'Duration\\'] <= 0]divvy_trips_df.drop(divvy_trips_df[divvy_trips_df[\\'Duration\\'] <= 0].index,inplace=True)Exploratory Data AnalysisLet’s begin by setting up the chart style, font size, figure size and figure facecolour using matplotlib. These are reflected only to matplot and seaborn charts using rcParamssns.set_style(\\'darkgrid\\')matplotlib.rcParams[\\'font.size\\'] = 14matplotlib.rcParams[\\'figure.figsize\\'] = (10, 6)matplotlib.rcParams[\\'figure.facecolor\\'] = \\'#00000000\\'Pie chart showing the percentage of each rideable_type is displayed below.The users prefer docked bike over the electric bike.The Docked bikes include the Classic Bike ,and Scooter that can be parked in any Divvy Stations throughout Chicago.Ebikes are only available at e-stations throughout the city to improve availability and to keep the city clean. Use the locking cable on the ebike to secure it at an e-station.From the pie chart we can infer that 89.1% prefer docked bike over electric bike in the year 2020.Further research for the cause showed that E-bikes have been introduced in the last quarter of the year 2020 and the Chicago Department of Transportation is reinvesting in traditional pedal bikes, which are cheaper to rent than e-bikes. E-bikes will remain in use, but no part of the city is limited to only E-bikes.#count of type of membersmember_types=divvy_trips_df.member_casual.value_counts()member_typesFrom the bar chart it is clearly visible that the most Divvy users prefer subscription model .Hence the people have responded positively towards the prices fixed for each rideable type.63.9 % of the users has the subscription model whereas the 36.1% of the people use it for casual rides.An annual membership costs $130.90 and includes free rides up to 45 minutes for regular bikes and discounts on e-bikes. Cyclists who purchase a single ride pay $1 to unlock the bike, then $0.17 per minute for a regular bike and $0.42 per minute for an e-bike.The total distance covered over docked bike is 4 times higher than that covered over electric bike. The expense of e-bikes has been a sticking point in some communities for reduced usage and the late introduction towards the last quarter of the year 2020.Let us plot a scatter plot to understand the shape of the area covered under the divvy bike sharing system and the density of the usage across the plot using the latitude as the x axis of the plot and longitude as the y axis of the plot.location is dataframe that consists of all the stations where divvy bikes are available and there 666 stations available combining the unique ids from both the start_station and end_stations.Folium is a Python library that enables the creation of interactive Leaflet maps. By default, it creates a map in a separate HTML file, but it can also create inline Jupyter maps. The location of the stations are plotted in a map using folium to identify the distribution of stations across Chicago.usage_by_stations=divvy_trips_df.start_station_name.value_counts()top_20_most_used_stations=usage_by_stations[:20]top_20_most_used_stationsThe horizontal barchart displays the most used stations along with the count of trips which started from these stations. Streeter Dr & Grand Ave is busiest station of DivvyThe histogram shows the distribution of number of stations within the range of value counts along the x axis of the power (10⁰) to (10⁴).The peak shows there are more than 280 stations where the overall use in the year is of the power in between (10³) and (10⁴).There are a few stations where the overall count of rides is less than 10.This may be because the stations are new and the people are not familiar with the usage .#Need to check why it is least used and find the reason to improve the reach of diivy bikesleast_used_stations = usage_by_stations[usage_by_stations < 10 ]least_used_stationsLess 2 % of the stations are rarely used .The count of usage of the least used stations is assumed to be less than 10. In order to resolve this problem over the years Divvy plans to celebrate the new stations, Divvy plans to host pop-up events at the stations, where Divvy outreach leaders will be available to answer questions about how to use the bike share system and hand out free passes for neighbors to try the bikes. The Divvy team announces these events in their email newsletter and on social media.# most used timehour = divvy_trips_df.started_at.dt.hourhour.value_counts()From the histogram ,we can infer that the most people use divvy_bikes around 14 hrs and 18 hrs where most people return home from work ,college ,or most people go out wih their family.# most used day of the monthday=divvy_trips_df.started_at.dt.daydayThe usage of divvy_rides have been uneven across the day of month and hence we cannot identify any particular pattern in usage. But the data available on the month end has unusually very low and hence need to identify the reason for this behaviour.Return the day of the week. It is assumed the week starts on Monday, which is denoted by 0 and ends on Sunday which is denoted by 6. This method is available on both Series with datetime values (using the dt accessor) or DatetimeIndex.# most used day of the weekday_of_week = divvy_trips_df.started_at.dt.dayofweekday_of_weekFrom the graph it can be concluded that the most hottest day in demand for divvy_rides are Saturdays. Let us check further to analyze whether the pattern of usage along the weekdays and weekends are the same.# usage in the weekendsaturday_hour=divvy_trips_df.started_at[divvy_trips_df.started_at.dt.dayofweek==5].dt.hour# usage in the weekdaysmonday_hour=divvy_trips_df.started_at[divvy_trips_df.started_at.dt.dayofweek==0].dt.hourThe two graphs gives two different peaks along the hours of the day .The usage along the Saturday gives a bell shaped curve that peaks at 13 to 15 hrs while on the weekdays the graph has two unequal peaks at 8 hrs and 17 hrs .distance_electric = divvy_electric.Distancedistance_docked =divvy_docked.Distance#Boxplot for electric_bikesfig=px.box(x=round(distance_electric,ndigits=1))fig.update_layout(    title=\"BOXPLOT ELECTRIC_BIKES\",    xaxis_title=\"DISTANCE(in KM)\",    )#Boxplot for docked bikesfig=px.box(x=round(distance_docked,ndigits=1))fig.update_layout(    title=\"BOXPLOT DOCKED_BIKES\",    xaxis_title=\"DISTANCE(in KM)\",    )The median distance of the docked bikes are higher than the electric bikes and this might be due to the less number of electric bikes available for commute or the user might need the bike for a longer duration or to cover a longer distance which the electric bike might fail to do.The data for electric bikes is not available for the first three quarters of the year 2020 .From the line graph we can infer that the average duration of each trip is lowest in the month of January for docked bikes and in the month of December for Electric Bikes.The month of January and February of 2020 has the lowest average distance for docked bikes .This can be due to the weather conditions of Chicago where December , January and February are the coldest months of the year. The snow covered roads might make the commutation by Divvy bikes difficult.Asking and Answering QuestionsQ1) Which is the most preffered rideable_type by divvy_users in 2020?count_of_rideableType=divvy_trips_df.rideable_type.value_counts()count_of_rideableTypeSince the electric bikes have been introduced in the last quarter of 2020,let us calculate the average of the rideable type to decide the most preferred one.From the average we can observe that the docked bikes is the most preferred in the year 2020.Q2) Do users prefer subscription over Single Casual use ?count_of_usertype=divvy_trips_df.member_casual.value_counts()count_of_usertypeWe know that the dataframe we are studying has 2986833 rows of data after cleaning.From the graph for the column rideable type it is clear that the percentage of users with membership is more than the single casual users .A single Casual use could be like $10, $11, $12 dollars but if you get a membership, it’s like, $3. And it’s faster and easier than going all the way in on the Blue Line trying to take a bus.Q3) Heat map of the various stations by usage ?From the heatmap we can infer that the maximum usage occur across the coast .Hence need further research to understand the exact reason the people use the divvy bikes for . Spots popular with tourists such as downtown and the lakefront are still busy riding locations, but less touristy areas have picked up in popularity. We can get to know the `station_id` and `station_name` by hovering over the Icon in the map.Q4) Which are the top 5 stations by usage ?divvy_trips_df.start_station_name.value_counts()[:5]Streeter Dr & Grand Ave ,Clark St & Elm St ,Theater on the Lake ,Wells St & Concord Ln,Lake Shore Dr & North Blvd are the top stations by usage .During the pandemic, ridership shifted to city neighborhoods. Spots popular with tourists such as downtown and the lakefront are still busy riding locations, but less touristy areas have picked up in popularity.Q5) Which is the busiest time and Days?divvy_trips_df.started_at.dt.hour.value_counts()We can see that the maximum usage comes in the evening. The bikes are one option for commuters to reach and come back from offices , but they have also been used by tourists, residents heading out for errands or social outings and recreational riders hence we have the maximum usage in the evening.divvy_trips_df.started_at.dt.day.value_counts()The first two weeks of the month have the maximum usage ,this may be because the last is usually the busiest part of the month when it comes to work .The people have salary in the beginning of the month where they spent on entertainment and exploring more.Q6)Which is the busiest part of day of week?divvy_trips_df.started_at.dt.dayofweek.value_counts()The day of the week with Monday=0, Sunday=6. It is assumed the week starts on Monday, which is denoted by 0 and ends on Sunday which is denoted by 6. Hence we can see that divvy users are the highest on Saturdays denoted by 5 followed by Friday denoted by 4 and Sunday denoted by 6.Q7) Which is the busiest hour on a weekend ?In the weekends the maximum usage occurs during the evening in between 17 to 19 hours.Q8) Which month has the lowest average distance covered?The month of January and February of 2020 has the lowest average distance for docked bikes .This can be due to the weather conditions of Chicago where December , January and February are the coldest months of the year. The snow covered roads might make the commutation by Divvy bikes difficult.Q9) Which month has the lowest average duration of trips ?The data for electric bikes is not available for the first three quarters of the year 2020 .From the line graph we can infer that the average duration of each trip is lowest in the month of January for docked bikes and in the month of December for Electric Bikes.SummaryThe member count is more over casual rides ,63.9 % of the users has the subscription model whereas the 36.1% of the people use it for casual rides.Most of the stations are located along the coast and as we move away from the coast the number decreases.0.7 % of the stations are used very less often .89.1% prefer docked bike over electric bike in the year 2020 .The following are the top 5 frequently used stations -Streeter Dr & Grand AveClark St & Elm StTheater on the LakeWells St & Concord LnLake Shore Dr & North BlvdMost usage of the bikes occurs in between 14:00 HRS and 19:00 HRS (probably people go for a evening ride, return from office )The two graphs gives two different peaks along the hours of the day .The usage on Saturday gives a bell shaped curve that peaks at 13 to 15 hours while on the weekdays the graph has two unequal peaks at 8 hrs and 17 hours ,hence we can conclude that the most users comes either use it for commuting to offices or colleges.From the heat map we can observe that the stations close to the beach is most often used .The frequency of usage further away from the coast is very low.The max distance and duration of all the trips in q4 is 48.3 KM using a docked bike and durations is 6 days using a docked bike.The total distance covered by users using docked bikes is more than the electric bike .The overall median distance covered by the docked by is slightly less than the overall median distance of the electric bike .The month of January and February of 2020 has the lowest average distance for docked bikes covered under the member type. This can be due to the weather conditions.ConclusionThus Divvy has in many ways become part of the fabric of Chicago. The bikes are one option for commuters to reach offices, but they have also been used by tourists, residents heading out for errands or social outings and recreational riders. Divvy should be working more on “socializing” e-bikes. They present an opportunity to shift more people out of cars and into more environmentally-friendly modes of transportation, but price is still a sticking point. The city should consider subsidizing Divvy e-bikes the way public transit is subsidized to make the cost more attainable .Further Divvy can do better in terms of expanding access, both just where bikes and stations are located, how readily available those bikes and stations are, and then critically how affordable they are.Future WorkCalculate the revenue by creating a csv file with rate and converting it into a pandas dataframe and merging it with the existing dataframe.Calcuate the revenue from each time of ride and subscription model.Intergrate with other quarters data over different and create an EDA for 3–4 year.Analyse the existing data over successive years for overall performance and take necessary steps to rectify the critical flaws if any .Integrate with weather data.ReferencesData Visualization using Python, Matplotlib and SeabornInteractive Visualization with PlotlyAdvanced Data Analysis Techniques with Python & PandasPlotting maps using FoliumCategorical DataPandas DateTimeOpendatasetsPandas DocumentationMarkDownSeaborn DocumentationMatplotlib DocumentationExploratory Data AnalysisPythonPandasPlotlyFolium----FollowWritten by Aswin Pushkar4 Followers·7 FollowingOpen to learning new tech and exploring new opportunities in Data science and Machine Learning.
